Hello 

I am Guru charan, CS grad student @ CSU Long Beach, and I am looking for full time opporunities starting june 23 and I'm very interested in the opportunities for new grad at Amazon.
I would be delighted at the chance to put the skills I have learned to use with you.

My technical skills:
    programming languages: Java, Python, Javascript
    Web Application Development:    JavaScript | Angular, React
    Back-End Technologies: 			Node.js, Python, GraphQL
    Database Technologies: 			MySQL and Elasticsearch
    CI-CD Tools: 				Docker and Kubernetes

Are there any work opportunities available for someone of my skill set and experience level? 

In case if there are no positions open at the moment, I thought it would be worth reaching out in the event that something comes up in the near future. 
In any case, I would love to connect with you to stay abreast of new openings. 

Many thanks for your time and consideration. 

Yours sincerely,
Guru charan

Never say: "I'm looking to make $150,000-$170,000"

Instead say: "I’m currently interviewing for positions that pay $150,000-$170,000”

"Looking to make" can be interpreted as “I’m hoping to make $150,000 but I’m currently earning much less”

"I'm currently interviewing" tells the interviewer that the MARKET is saying you’re worth $150,000-$170,000 and that you’re also in DEMAND from other companies.

Practice this in front of the mirror if you decide to take the route of disclosing a range.

Hello, I'm reaching out because I came across job posting for NodeJS with Javascript and I'm interested because I have a background in doing that particular job for 5 years. I saw that the job description requires that I have 4 years of experience using NodeJs. I actually have been using NodeJS for the last 5 years and I use it daily. 

I understand that you may or may not be the recruiter who supports these types of roles so if you could potentially point me to the right person or had any suggestions on how to get in touch with the right person that would be greatly appreciated.
