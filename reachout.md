Dear {}

I am a recent Engineering graduate from CSU Long Beach, and I am looking for full time opporunities starting june 23.
I would be delighted at the chance to put the skills I have learned to use with you.

My technical skills:
    programming languages: Java, Python, Javascript
    Web Application Development:    JavaScript | Angular, React
    Back-End Technologies: 			Node.js, Python, GraphQL
    Database Technologies: 			MySQL and Elasticsearch
    CI-CD Tools: 				Docker and Kubernetes

Are there any work opportunities available for someone of my skill set and experience level? 

In case if there are no positions open at the moment, I thought it would be worth reaching out in the event that something comes up in the near future. 
In any case, I would love to connect with you to stay abreast of new openings. 

Many thanks for your time and consideration. 

Yours sincerely,
Guru charan
