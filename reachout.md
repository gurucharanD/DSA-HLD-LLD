Hello 

I am Guru charan, CS grad student @ CSU Long Beach, and I am looking for full time opporunities starting june 23 and I'm very interested in the opportunities for new grad at Amazon.
I would be delighted at the chance to put the skills I have learned to use with you.

My technical skills:
    programming languages: Java, Python, Javascript
    Web Application Development:    JavaScript | Angular, React
    Back-End Technologies: 			Node.js, Python, GraphQL
    Database Technologies: 			MySQL and Elasticsearch
    CI-CD Tools: 				Docker and Kubernetes

Are there any work opportunities available for someone of my skill set and experience level? 

In case if there are no positions open at the moment, I thought it would be worth reaching out in the event that something comes up in the near future. 
In any case, I would love to connect with you to stay abreast of new openings. 

Many thanks for your time and consideration. 

Yours sincerely,
Guru charan

Never say: "I'm looking to make $150,000-$170,000"

Instead say: "I’m currently interviewing for positions that pay $150,000-$170,000”

"Looking to make" can be interpreted as “I’m hoping to make $150,000 but I’m currently earning much less”

"I'm currently interviewing" tells the interviewer that the MARKET is saying you’re worth $150,000-$170,000 and that you’re also in DEMAND from other companies.

Practice this in front of the mirror if you decide to take the route of disclosing a range.
